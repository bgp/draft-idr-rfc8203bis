                This document updates RFC8203 by defining an Extended BGP Administrative Shutdown Communication to improve communication using multibyte character sets.

            <t>
                The <xref target="RFC8203">Administrative Shutdown Communication</xref> is a simple mechanism to transit a short freeform <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> message as part of a <xref target="RFC4271">Cease NOTIFICATION message</xref> to inform the peer why the BGP session is being shutdown or reset.
            </t>
            <t>
                Feedback from operators based in regions which predominantly use multibyte character sets, showed
                that messages similar in meaning to what can be send in other languages in using single-byte encoding
                failed to fit within the Length constraints as specified by <xref target="RFC8203" />. For example,
                the phrase: 'Planned works to adding switch to stack. Completion time - 30 minutes' has length 69 bytes.
                Its translation in Russian 'Плановые работы по добавлению коммутатора в стек. Время завершения - 30 минут'
                has length 139 bytes.
            </t>

            <t>
                This document extends the length of the Administrative Shutdown Communication to 255 octets.
            </t>

        <section anchor="rfc8203" title="Changes to RFC 8203">
            <t>
                This section updates <xref target="RFC8203" /> to specify the maximum length of an Administrative Shutdown Communication.
            </t>
            <t>
                The following paragraph replaces the Length definition in Section 2 (Shutdown Communication):
            </t>
            <t>
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>
                        <list style="hanging">
                            <t hangText="Length:">
                                this 8-bit field represents the length of the Shutdown Communication field in octets. When the length value is zero, no Shutdown Communication field follows.
                            </t>
                        </list>
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of Section 5 (Security Considerations):
            </t>
            <t>
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>
                        As BGP Shutdown Communications are likely to appear in syslog output, there is a risk that carefully constructed Shutdown Communication might be formatted by receiving systems in a way to make them appear as additional syslog messages.
                        To limit the ability to mount such an attack, the BGP Shutdown Communication is limited to 255 octets in length.
                    </t>
                </list>

        <section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">
            <t>
                This section records the status of known implementations of the
                protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
                this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
                RFC7942. The description of implementations in this
                section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
                progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
                individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
                IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
                information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
                This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
                of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
                to note that other implementations may exist.
            </t>
            <t>
                As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
                Shutdown Communication:
